# TVS CREDIT EPIC 6 FINAL PROTOTYPE

## Project Overview

The current EMI calculator on our website only provides simple interest calculations with basic outputs, without taking into account the user's unique financial situation. This project aims to enhance the calculator by integrating AI/ML-powered loan suggestions. These suggestions will offer users more personalized loan recommendations, helping them choose the best loan options based on their financial inputs, such as principal, time, and interest rate.
